**NOTE:** GoKi is currently undergoing a period of significant developement to make it easier to make useful, fast, and beautiful apps and support running apps on mobile. As such, some of the information in this repository and on the [GoKi website](https://GoKi.dev) may be incorrect. Furthermore, there may be breaking changes soon, so starting new apps with this framework is not recommended at this time; if you do, please be ready to adjust to any breaking changes. If you want to accelerate the improvement of GoKi, please contribute by following the [Contribution Guidelines](https://goki.dev/docs/general/contributionguidelines/). Developement of Gi is currently happening on this branch. For the latest stable version of Gi, import version 1.3.19 and see the [v1 branch](https://goki.dev/gi/v2/tree/v1).

GoGi is part of the [GoKi](https://GoKi.dev) Go language (golang) full strength tree structure system (ki = æœ¨ = tree in Japanese)

`package gi` is a scenegraph-based 2D and 3D GUI / graphics interface (Gi) in Go, that functions similar to HTML / CSS / SVG  and Qt.

NOTE: Requires Go version `1.18+` -- now using the new generics.

See the [Wiki](https://goki.dev/gi/v2/wiki) for more docs (increasingly extensive), [Install](https://goki.dev/gi/v2/wiki/Install) instructions (mostly basic `go build` procedure, but does now depend on `cgo` on all platforms due to `glfw`, so see details for each platform -- for mac you must now install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com), and [Google Groups goki-gi](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/goki-gi) email list, and the new github [Discussions](https://goki.dev/gi/v2/discussions) tool.

GoGi uses the [GoKi](https://goki.dev/ki/v2) tree infrastructure to implement a scenegraph-based GUI framework in full native idiomatic Go, with minimal OS-specific backend interfaces based originally on the [Shiny](https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/shiny) drivers, now using [go-gl/glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) and vulkan-based [vgpu](https://goki.dev/vgpu/v2), and supporting MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

The overall design integrates existing standards and conventions from widely-used frameworks, including Qt (overall widget design), HTML / CSS (styling), and SVG (rendering).  The core `Layout` object automates most of the complexity associated with GUI construction (including scrolling), so the programmer mainly just needs to add the elements, and set their style properties -- similar to HTML.  The main 2D framework also integrates with a 3D scenegraph, supporting interesting combinations of these frameworks (see `gi3d` package and [examples/gi3d](https://goki.dev/gi/v2/tree/master/examples/gi3d)).  Currently GoGi is focused on desktop systems, but nothing should prevent adaptation to mobile. 

See [Gide](https://goki.dev/gi/v2de) for a complete, complex application written in GoGi (an IDE), and likewise the [Emergent](https://github.com/emer/emergent) neural network simulation environment (the prime motivator for the whole project), along with the various examples in this repository for lots of useful demonstrations -- start with the  [Widgets](https://goki.dev/gi/v2/tree/master/examples/widgets) example which has a bit of a tutorial introduction.

# Main Features

* Has all the standard widgets: `Button`, `Menu`, `Slider`, `TextField`, `SpinBox`, `ComboBox` etc, with tooltips, hover, focus, copy / paste (full native clipboard support), drag-n-drop -- the full set of standard GUI functionality.  See `gi/examples/widgets` for a demo of all the widgets.

* `Layout` auto-organizes and auto-sizes everything to configure interfaces that "just work" across different scales, resolutions, platforms.  Automatically remembers and reinstates window positions and sizes across sessions, and supports standard `Ctrl+` and `Ctrl-` zooming of display scale.

* CSS-based styling allows customization of everything -- native style properties are HTML compatible (with all standard `em`, `px`, `pct` etc units), including HTML "rich text" styling for all text rendering (e.g., in `Label` widget) -- can decorate any text with inline tags (`<strong>`, `<em>` etc), and even include links.  Styling is now separated out into `gist` package, for easier navigation.

* Compiles in seconds, compared to many minutes to hours for comparable alternatives such as Qt, and with minimal cgo dependency.  As of April 2019 we now depend on the [glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) cross-platform GUI infrastructure system, and as of May 2022 vulkan provides all the rendering (2D via vdraw, 3D via vphong):  [vgpu](https://goki.dev/vgpu/v2).

* Fully self-contained -- does *not* use OS-specific native widgets -- results in simpler, consistent code across platforms, and is `HiDPI` capable and scalable using standard `Ctrl/Cmd+Plus or Minus` key, and in `Preferences`.  This also allows a complete 2D GUI to be embedded into a 3D scene, for example.

* `SVG` element (in `svg` sub-package) supports SVG rendering -- used for Icons internally and available for advanced graphics displays -- see `gi/examples/svg` for viewer and start on editor, along with a number of test .svg files.

* **Model / View** paradigm with `reflect`ion-based view elements that display and manipulate all the standard Go types (in `giv` sub-package), from individual types (e.g., int, float display in a `SpinBox`, "enum" const int types in a `ComboBox` chooser) to composite data structures, including `StructView` editor of `struct` fields, `MapView` and `SliceView` displays of `map` and `slice` elements (including full editing / adding / deleting of elements), and full-featured `TableView` for a `slice`-of-`struct` and `TreeView` for GoKi trees.
    + `TreeView` enables a built-in GUI editor / inspector for designing gui elements themselves.  Just press `Control+Alt+I` in any window to pull up this editor / inspector.  Scene graphs can be automatically saved / loaded from JSON files, to provide a basic GUI designer framework -- just load and add appropriate connections..
    
* GoGi is a "standard" *retained-mode* (scenegraph-based) GUI, as compared to *immediate-mode* GUIs such as [Gio](https://gioui.org).  As such, GoGi automatically takes care of everything for you, but as a result you sacrifice control over every last detail.  Immediate mode gives you full control, but also the full burden of control -- you have to code every last behavior yourself.  In GoGi, you have extensive control through styling and closure-based "callback" methods, in the same way you would in a standard front-end web application (so it will likely be more familiar to many users), but if you want to do something very different, you will likely need to code a new type of Widget, which can be more difficult as then you need to know more about the overall infrastructure.  Thus, if you are likely to be doing fairly standard things and don't feel the need for absolute control, GoGi will likely be an easier experience.

# Code Overview

There are three main types of 2D nodes:

* `Viewport` nodes that manage their own `image.RGBA` bitmap and can upload that directly to the `goosi.Texture` (GPU based) that then uploads directly to the `goosi.Window`.  The parent `Window` has a master `Viewport` that backs the entire window, and is what most `Widget`'s render into.
    + Popup `Dialog` and `Menu`'s have their own viewports that are layered on top of the main window viewport.
    + `SVG` and its subclass `Icon` are containers for SVG-rendering nodes.

* `Widget` nodes that use the full CSS-based styling (e.g., the Box model etc), are typically placed within a `Layout` -- they use `units` system with arbitrary DPI to transform sizes into actual rendered `dots` (term for actual raw resolution-dependent pixels -- "pixel" has been effectively co-opted as a 96dpi display-independent unit at this point).  Widgets have non-overlapping bounding boxes (`BBox` -- cached for all relevant reference frames).

* `SVG` rendering nodes that directly set properties on the `girl.Paint` object and typically have their own geometry etc -- they should be within a parent `SVG` viewport, and their geom units are determined entirely by the transforms etc and we do not support any further unit specification -- just raw float values.

General Widget method conventions:
* `SetValue` kinds of methods are wrapped in `UpdateStart` / `End`, but do NOT emit a signal.
* `SetValueAction` calls `SetValue` and emits the signal.
This allows other users of the widget that also recv the signal to not trigger themselves, but typically you want the update, so it makes sense to have that in the basic version.  `ValueView` in particular requires this kind of behavior.

The best way to see how the system works are in the `examples` directory, and by interactively modifying any existing gui using the interactive reflective editor via `Control+Alt+I`.

# Backend

The `oswin` and `oswin/driver/vkos` packages provide interface abstractions for hardware-level implementations, now using [vgpu](https://goki.dev/vgpu/v2) and [glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) (version 3.3) provides the basic platform-specific details along with a few other bits of platform-specific code.

All of the main "front end" code just deals with `image.RGBA` through the [girl](https://goki.dev/gi/v2/tree/master/girl) rendering library, using `girl.Paint` methods, which was adapted from [fogleman/gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg), and we use [srwiley/rasterx](https://github.com/srwiley/rasterx) for CPU-based rasterization to the image, which is fast and SVG performant.   The [vgpu/vdraw](https://goki.dev/vgpu/v2/vdraw) package performs optimized GPU texture-based compositing to assemble the final display in a way that minimizes the copying of image data up to the GPU, and supports overlays such as popups and sprites.  Any 3D scene elements are accessed directly within the GPU.

# Detailed Render Logic

Rendering is done in 5 separate passes:

0. Config: In a MeFirst downward pass, Viewport pointer is set, styles are
   initialized, and any other widget-specific init is done.

1. SetStyle: In a MeFirst downward pass, all properties are cached out in
   an inherited manner, and incorporating any css styles, into either the
   Paint (SVG) or Style (Widget) object for each Node.  Only done once after
   structural changes -- styles are not for dynamic changes.

2. GetSize: MeLast downward pass, each node first calls
   g.Layout.Reset(), then sets their LayoutSize according to their own
   intrinsic size parameters, and/or those of its children if it is a Layout.

3. DoLayout: MeFirst downward pass (each node calls on its children at
   appropriate point) with relevant parent BBox that the children are
   constrained to render within -- they then intersect this BBox with their
   own BBox (from BBox2D) -- typically just call DoLayoutBase for default
   behavior -- and add parent position to AllocPos. Layout does all its
   sizing and positioning of children in this pass, based on the GetSize data
   gathered bottom-up and constraints applied top-down from higher levels.
   Typically only a single iteration is required but multiple are supported
   (needed for word-wrapped text or flow layouts).

4. Render: Final rendering pass, each node is fully responsible for
   rendering its own children, to provide maximum flexibility (see
   RenderChildren) -- bracket the render calls in PushBounds / PopBounds
   and a false from PushBounds indicates that VpBBox is empty and no
   rendering should occur.  Nodes typically connect / disconnect to receive
   events from the window based on this visibility here.

   * Move2D: optional pass invoked by scrollbars to move elements relative to
   their previously-assigned positions.

   * SVG nodes skip the Size and Layout passes, and render directly into
   parent SVG viewport



# v2 Rewrite TODO / Discussion

## TODO

* search for Cursor and fix everywhere with new cursors

* Get rid of extra UpdateStart / End in Config* calls -- all are wrapped in outer Config so unnec.

* get rid of all the extra Config calls in SetStyle and Render!

* fix all `Set..`, `...Action` state-changing methods to detect whether Config, layout, or just render is needed. 

* in general, "SetNeedsFullReRender" -> SetNeedsLayout(vp, updt) or true

* TextField:KeyChord -- need dialog!  should have a better mech for this.

## Window is not a Ki

* contains a stack of Viewports, the first of which is the main window, rest are popups.

## Viewport is not a Ki, is the base struct for each separate tree

* Viewport represents: main window and each popup -> window, tooltip, dialog, etc.

* Viewport has a Frame field which is the base of each tree

* is passed as arg, not stored on obj: all methods take the viewport!
* so much cleaner vs. mutexes, safe finding, etc.

## Init2D -> Config

* ConfigAll called during window Show, but otherwise not called!
* manually call Config on individual elements if properties change.

## Style2D -> SetStyle

* called automatically for any state change

* Widget SetState method is called with bitflag to set: checks if state is not yet set: if so, sets flag, calls SetStyle() wrapped in UpdateStart / End.

## Robust updating logic redo

See [render.go](gi/render.go) for updated version:

* Config calls SetStyle, within an overall Update Start / End block

* ki.UpdateEnd() in Config or SetStyle calls SetRender method, which sets flag in node (all below it will be rendered) and a NeedsRender flag on the Viewport (need the viewport for this -- cache in Config, only use for setting this one flag!).

* Window iterates through Viewports on a timer loop, and checks if any have VpNeedsRender flag set, and not VpIsRendering flag -- calls RenderAll on them, passing viewport down.  *first* step is to clear VpNeedsRender flag so any further updates can register need, and each node's NeedsRender flag is cleared after rendering *starts*.  Better to err on side of extra rendering.

* If Config modifies the tree, then FullRender is needed: GetSize, DoLayout, then Render

* If State changes, Style then Render needs to be called..

## Large Scale Organization

In flutter, everything is a widget, and multiple windows are not supported:  https://github.com/orgs/flutter/projects/39/views/1.  Everything is basically a widget, and "stateless widget" is basically a container for other widgets (i.e., a layout).  Not much of a strong taxonomy.   An explicit "ModalBarrier" widget is inserted to set off a foreground widget from stuff in the background.  A "Route" connects widgets -- e.g., a button can route to another, and then route back..  popups can be modal or not, etc.   Anyway, the Widget is always the unit of organization (no specific distinction or name for a coherent collection thereof) and they kinda live wherever and are drawn when needed somehow.

GoGi is based around the principle that Layout is automatic and requires coordinating a coherent collection of Widgets, which have a given chunk of space to render into.  This collection is the contents of a window, a dialog, a popup, etc: A Viewport in the current naming.  But Viewport is not a particularly great name for a coherent collection of widgets.  In Qt and other graphics contexts, it is more of a 3D construct, or is involved in scrolling (a window onto a larger scene).

Entities:

* `Scene` is a good name for a coherent collection of Widgets.  Viewport -> Scene.  Scene is the basic unit of content, and has its own Image that it renders onto.  It can handle the distribution of events, and translate the events into local coordinates instead of requiring everyone to have all the bboxes mapped out to window level.  Basically, window routes events into Scene, which subtracts its relative pos and takes it from there.  It has its own logic for managing focus transitions among widgets.  Layout manages the layout of widgets within the scene, as now, and Scene manages the rendering and layout updates as now implemented.

* Could have a collection of Scenes lying around, or make them on the fly.  They can be manged with a name map and it should be easy to grab one and use it as needed, in a SceneLibrary -- can select one by name to show as a main window content, and e.g., have the back arrow decoration to get back.

* `Stage` is a "physical" place where a `Scene` can play out.  Like the overall metaphor but not the confusion with "stage" as a step in a sequence or progression.   It has a `*Scene` pointer and logic for managing its specific kind of presentation.  It is trivial to move a Scene to a different Stage as needed.

There are many different types of Stages:
* `WindowStage` has a basic `Stage` for showing its main content.  Different Scenes can take over this stage, or layer on top of each other..
* `Menu` is a modal popup stage for menu items, like `Tooltip`, `Completer`, etc.
* `ModalDialog` is a modal dialog popup within the current window: it throws a scrim over anything below it, and blocks all events.
* `ModelessDialog` is a modeless dialog popup, with window move and close handles (options with defaults).
* `BottomSheet` pops up from the bottom with a handle, and scrims out others

* Probably just have a StageBase with various general parameters (modal, scrim, position relative to window, etc), and types that embed and implement specific cases.

* Stage manages additional popups within a stage, and Window has a stack of ActiveStages for all the Dialogs and SnackBars etc.

* Window needs to provide an overall context in terms of DPI and size, and can optionally resize to new stage content.  In general a Scene or Stage should not be overly dependent on window, and vice-versa.

Idea for progressive structview dialogs each pulling up a diff window in current code: instead have them form a stack in a Window with "back" arrow to go back (and forward!)

### earlier notes

* Mobile is basically a single window app.  Desktop can have multiple separate windows.  Need an intermediate abstraction for a separate "sheet" or "surface" of content that can either be within a separate window, or arranged in various ways within the same window.

* Viewport organizes the rendering tree, but doesn't contain the further logic associated with a dialog, menu, etc.  Currently, we're wrapping all that logic into Window which has special cases for each thing.  It would be better to make this more encapsulated.

* A menu, tooltip, completer, or snackbar (popups) are associated with the logical flow of their parent sheet, and all the focus and logic of these should be managed separately for each.  Probably also the event manager should be separate for each -- first pass the window figures out where the event is going at the "sheet" level, then hands it off to the sheet to manage from there.  Basically, the outer window is just like a window manager: it handles distributing events, optionally resizing and positioning handles, and distributing events, and everything else is handled therein.
