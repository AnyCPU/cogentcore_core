# enums
Enums provides utilities for creating and using enumerated types in Go. There are two main parts of enums: package `enums`, which defines the `Enumer` and `BitEnumer` interfaces, and the enum code generation tool `enumgen`, which is based on [dmarkham/enumer](https://github.com/dmarkham/enumer) and [stringer](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer).
