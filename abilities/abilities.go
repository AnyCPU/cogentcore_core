	Selectable

	// Activatable means it can be made Active
	Activatable

	// Active state otherwise associated with Activatable items.
	Pressable

	// LongPressable indicates that an element can be LongPressed
	LongPressable

	// DoubleClickable indicates that an element does something different
	// when it is clicked on twice in a row. If this is not set, DoubleClick
	// events are processed in the same way as Click events.

	Draggable

	// Droppable means it can receive DragEnter, DragLeave, and Drop events
	// (not specific to current Drag item, just generally)

	// to change value.  Cannot be both Draggable and Slideable.

	// Focusable means it can be Focused: capable of receiving and processing key events directly
	// and typically changing the style when focused to indicate this property to the user.
	Focusable

	// without being in the Focused state, and it does not grab focus or
	// take away focus from other elements, and does not change its style.
	// These key events are processed _after_ the Focused item.
	// Typically they are navigation keys that individual elements do not process.
