Cogent Core is a free and open source framework for building powerful, fast, and cogent 2D and 3D apps that run on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and the Web with a single pure Go codebase, allowing you to Code Once, Run Everywhere.

> **NOTE:** Cogent Core is currently undergoing a period of significant development to make it easier to make powerful, fast, and cogent apps. As such, some of the information on this website and in the Cogent Core repositories may be incorrect. Furthermore, there are ongoing breaking changes, so starting new apps with this framework is not recommended at this time; if you do, please be ready to adjust to any breaking changes. We are planning to make a v1 stable release in early June (see the [v1 milestone](https://github.com/cogentcore/core/milestone/1)).

This documentation is organized into five main sections: Getting Started, Basics, Widgets, Views, and Architecture. We recommend that you read the Getting Started and Basics sections first, as those will provide you with a solid foundation for using Cogent Core. Then, you can read specific parts of the Widgets and Views sections as you need them. The Architecture section contains more detailed information that you can read if you are curious, confused, or interested in contributing to Cogent Core.
