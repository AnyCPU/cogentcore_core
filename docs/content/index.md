Cogent Core is a free and open source framework for building powerful, fast, and cogent 2D and 3D apps that run on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and the Web with a single pure Go codebase, allowing you to Code Once, Run Everywhere.

> **NOTE:** Cogent Core is currently undergoing a period of significant development to make it easier to make powerful, fast, and cogent apps. As such, some of the information on this website and in the Cogent Core repositories may be incorrect. Furthermore, there are ongoing breaking changes, so starting new apps with this framework is not recommended at this time; if you do, please be ready to adjust to any breaking changes. We are planning to make a v1 stable release in early June (see the [v1 milestone](https://github.com/cogentcore/core/milestone/1)).

This website itself is a Cogent Core app running on the web using wasm. It contains extensive documentation and interactive running examples.

This documentation is organized into six main sections: Getting Started, Basics, Widgets, Views, Advanced, and Architecture. We recommend that you read the Getting Started and Basics sections first, as those will provide you with a solid foundation for using Cogent Core. Then, you can read specific parts of the Widgets and Views sections as you need them. You should read the Advanced section later once you have some experience with Cogent Core and are ready to make more advanced apps with it. The Architecture section contains detailed information about the structure of Cogent Core that you can read if you are curious, confused, or contributing to Cogent Core.

# Why Cogent Core?

There are many different ways to build apps, including cross-platform frameworks like Flutter, web frameworks like React, desktop frameworks like Qt, and other Go frameworks like Fyne. However, all of those approaches fall short in various critical ways.

Cogent Core is the only app framework that runs on every major platform while supporting powerful features like 3D, text editors, videos, value views, data plotting, and markdown, customizable styling tailored to user preferences, elegant and easy-to-use APIs, automatic and customizable content layout, and effortless events and updating.

With Cogent Core, you get all of the elegance of Go, the deployability of React, and the power of Qt. You can make anything from fully featured IDEs to 3D neural network models of the brain with Cogent Core's elegant approach to powerful, easy-to-use, and fully cross-platform apps.

You can install Cogent Core and build your first app in just two commands and seven lines of code, and apps compile in just a couple of seconds and run at GPU-accelerated speeds. Every part of your development experience is guided by a comprehensive set of interactive example-based documentation, easy-to-use command line tools specialized for Cogent Core, and active support and development from the Cogent Core developers.
