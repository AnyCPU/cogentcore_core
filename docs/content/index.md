# **NOTE:**

Cogent Core is currently undergoing a period of significant development to make it easier to make powerful, fast, and cogent apps. As such, some of the information on this website and in the Cogent Core repositories may be incorrect. Furthermore, there are ongoing breaking changes, so starting new apps with this framework is not recommended at this time; if you do, please be ready to adjust to any breaking changes. We are planning to make a v1 stable release in early June (see the [v1 milestone](https://github.com/cogentcore/core/milestone/1)).
