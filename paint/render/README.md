# paint render API

This package defines interfaces and data types for paint `Renderer` and `Render`:

* `Render` is a sequence (slice) of `Item` elements that are generated by `paint.Painter` functions, such as `Circle`, `DrawImage`, or `TextLines`.

* `Renderer` gets `Render` data and renders it into a specific form. The `rasterx.Renderer` generates an `image.RGBA` image of the paint commands. `htmlcanvas.Renderer` uses html canvas on the web to render. `SVG` and `PDF` create the corresponding documents.

In `core`, the `Scene.Painter` creates the appropriate `Renderer` for the current platform, using the `paint.NewSourceRenderer` function, and the platform-specific `composer.Source` knows how to use this renderer to create the relevant rendering for that platform. On the web, the `composer.Composer` manages the web canvases to produce the correct overall results across the multiple sources that are composed to make a final viewed image in an app.
