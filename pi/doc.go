Package pi provides the top-level repository for the GoPi interactive parser system.

The code is organized into the various sub-packages, dealing with the different
stages of parsing etc.

* pi: integrates all the parsing elements into the overall parser framework.

* langs: has the parsers for specific languages, including Go (of course), markdown
and tex (latter are lexer-only)

Note that the GUI editor framework for creating and testing parsers is
in the Gide package: https://github.com/goki/gide  under the piv sub-package.
