// Source is a source of input to a [Composer].
// Sources typically define multiple draw functions behind build tags
// or type switches to provide platform-specific implementations for
// the two main [Composer] implementations ([ComposerDrawer] and [ComposerWeb]).
//
// The source object MUST be fully self-contained and not have
// any pointers into other state: it should fully describe
// the rendering, and be runnable in a separate goroutine.
