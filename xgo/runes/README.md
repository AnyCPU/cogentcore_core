# runes

Package runes provides a small subset of functions that are found in strings, bytes standard packages, for rune slices.  For rendering, and other logic, it is best to keep raw data in runes, and not having to convert back and forth to byte or string is more efficient.

These are largely copied from strings or bytes packages.
